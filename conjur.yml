# -----------------------------
# Conjur configuration file
# -----------------------------
#
# This file configures Conjur settings in YAML format. These settings generally
# consist of lines in the form:
#
# name: value
#
# Comments are introduced with "#" anywhere on a line.
#
# The commented-out settings shown in this file represent the default values.
#
# These configuration values are loaded by the Conjur process at startup and can
# be overridden by providing environment variables of the same name prefixed by
# CONJUR. For example, you can override the trusted_proxies value from this
# file by setting CONJUR_TRUSTED_PROXIES in the environment.

# Trusted proxies ensures that DAP can properly source client IP addresses.
#
# This setting should be a list of IP addresses and/or IP address ranges in CIDR
# notation. For example:
#
# trusted_proxies:
#   - 192.168.1.1
#   - 127.0.0.1

# trusted_proxies: []

# This is a placeholder key to allow AnywayConfig to parse this sample config
# file consisting only of comments. Once the following PR is merged and
# released, this will no longer be necessary:
# https://github.com/palkan/anyway_config/pull/83
